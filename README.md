### Optimized for All Websites & Runs Seamlessly on Linux & Windows Build Servers

**Dramatically improve your website's performance and search engine rankings by automatically compressing your web assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG, JSON, XML, WASM, and more) within your GitHub Actions workflow!** DeploySlim utilizes cutting-edge Brotli and widely compatible Gzip compression to significantly reduce file sizes. This results in lightning-fast load times, enhanced user experience, and a boost in SEO, regardless of your website's technology or your chosen build server environment on GitHub Actions.

on: [push] # Or your preferred workflow trigger (e.g., pull_request, release)

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Or use `windows-latest` for Windows builds

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # ... Your website build process (e.g., npm build, Hugo, Jekyll) ...

          algorithms: 'br,gz' # Optional: Specify compression algorithms (default: br,gz)
          brotli-level: 9      # Optional: Set Brotli compression level (0-11, default: 6) - Higher level = smaller files, longer processing
          gzip-level: 7        # Optional: Set Gzip compression level (0-9, default: 6) - Higher level = smaller files, longer processing

      # ... Your website deployment steps (e.g., deploying to Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3) ...
